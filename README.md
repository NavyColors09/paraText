# Software Engineering for Scientists <br/> paraText Project

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to write an application that expands contextual information of advanced vocabulary found in technical texts. The user clicks on an underlined word by right clicking for replacement options. They would have to shift and click to toggle sync options for the highlighted word. When the text is red, this indicates that all instances of that word has been replaced with the same options. If the text is in yellow, this indicates that the change for the text is unique and will not trigger changes in other instances of the word.
