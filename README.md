# Software Engineering for Scientists <br/> paraText Project

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to write an application that expands contextual information of advanced vocabulary found in technical texts. The user clicks on an underlined word by right clicking for replacement options. The user would then shift and click to toggle sync options for the highlighted word. When the text is red, this indicates that all instances of that word has been replaced with the same options. If the text is in yellow, this indicates that the change for the text is unique and will not trigger changes in other instances of the word. 

The motivation of this project is based on the need to make technical writing more accessible to a general audience. Communication of an educated audience requires specific vernacular native to that field. This is different for an uneducated audience where communication requires additional context. Our goal for this project is to create an expandable text interpretation tool for increasing accessibility to scientific texts. We have designed a Python GUI as the prototype for future HCI projects that aim to create interactive texts that provide contextual meaning for any targetted audience.
